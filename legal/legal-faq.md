### What jurisdiction is Envelop in?&#x20;

We operate under the rules of the Web 3.0 mechanic, which means that we follow universally recognised principles and norms of international law and morality, and operate outside specific jurisdictions.

## What is a NIFTSY Token from a legal point of view?&#x20;

It is a technically necessary tool without which the Protocol, the Oracle and the Index cannot work together optimally within the Project.

To do this, go to the "Lite paper" subsection of the "Key documents" section and then study the "Disclamers" chapter.
