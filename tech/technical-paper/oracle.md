# Oracle

Oracle is part of the Project, which is built on three main elements: a scoring system for pre- and post-asset analysis; a classical antifraud system that works on algorithms to assess possible fraud schemes with NFT of any order; an AI system that works on the principles of heuristic analysis to assess NFT assets of any order.
