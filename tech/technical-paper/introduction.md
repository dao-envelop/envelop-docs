# Introduction

We came up with ENVELOP (NIFTSY) when we studied the entire NFT market over the last four years. We are not an aggregator, not another platform for creating NFTs, and certainly not a new blockchain. But we provide an opportunity to make money for everyone: the author, the publisher, the distributor, the developer, the stakeholder, and any active member of the community.

In this documentation we will explain the technology stack that is used in ENVELOP (NIFTSY). We will introduce the basic working methods of the Protocol (then Oracle and Index), and describe the basic functionality of the elements described.
