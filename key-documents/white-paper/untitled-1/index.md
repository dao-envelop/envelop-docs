# Index

An index is a numerical and/or alphabetic indicator of something. Envelop (NIFTSY) creates indicators from Index.Envelop:

1. "Purity" of the NFT market;
2. The congestion of this market at the moment;
3. Demand;
4. Etc.

The index has three main roles:

1. Objective quantification of the market;
2. A tool for following the market;
3. A trading tool.

In doing so, the Index could be the first full-fledged decentralized solution, because:

1. The data will be derived from different sources autonomously;
2. The final version of Oracle will be fully opened (with an immediate opening of the Protocol);&#x20;
3. Due to the implementation approach via primitive models, the general Index can be simplified/complicated almost infinitely (taking into account the costs of scaling);
4. The data provider can be any service: centralized, decentralized, distributed;
5. The index is not a derivative, but a stand-alone assessment tool.

As the manipulative practice regarding Bitcoin has shown in relation to the allegedly non-environmental nature of the Network (see link for details), the decentralized world is subject to the same information attacks as the centralized world. But unlike the latter, the decentralized world has more tools to combat fake news, unfounded accusations and other manipulations, including by creating tools that work in an untrusted environment of any level (order).

Precisely for this reason, one of the results of the development of NIFTSY is the creation of a fully decentralized index, which independently of any third party gives results about the NFT market by means of one measurable parameter or several measurable parameters (in a product deployment). This provides not only a quantitative, but also a qualitative assessment of the correlation between assets, traders, derivatives and other entities.

This index is formed at the initial stage in the same way as Oracle, i.e. through ZK-mechanics, which later will be opened to the community as both a common base and assembled evaluation algorithms.

Now let us try to consider the Project Architecture in the oneâ€™s entirety and move on to the basic linking element of all three components, the Token.
