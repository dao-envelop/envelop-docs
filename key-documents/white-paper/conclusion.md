# Conclusion

So, a Project is a set of three main parts: Protocol, Oracle, Index, the linking element of which is the Token.

The Project can be defined as an L1 level cross-chain solution for interaction with NFT of any order/level of complexity.

The project is designed and developed as a DAO.

The project provides Protocol, Oracle and Index capabilities based on the principles of openness and decentralization, but with certain stages of their elementsâ€™ disclosure.

The project aims to unify DAO & DEX solutions, regardless of the implementation specifics of the latter, and to develop a toolkit of simple mechanics of any order liquidity management.
