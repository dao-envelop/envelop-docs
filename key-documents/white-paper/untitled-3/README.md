# Industry (market) analysis and NIFTSY's place in it

Since Envelop (hereinafter referred to as the Project) is initially built at the intersection of several markets (DeFi, NFT, DAO, DEX) and has the cross-chain feature, we will try to cover all segments very briefly and share the conclusions why we believe Envelop is not just a competitive product, but also a promising global solution for further Web 3.0 evolution over the next 5-10 years.

This section is primarily intended for those who are familiar with the markets listed above, and want a brief, but comprehensive analysis to understand the trends within which the Project was organized and received development.&#x20;
