# Roadmap. Part. #01

From November 2020 to February 2021, DAO NIFTSY was formed and work began on researching the NFT market.&#x20;

In March 2021, a minimal product was made and the team participated in the Binance hackathon.&#x20;

Currently, an Alpha version of the protocol is being worked on (until July 2021).&#x20;

After that, it is planned to refine the functionality of the Protocol and expand the Token functions, including - in connection with the IDO held in August-September.&#x20;

Next, the development of other elements of the Project starts: Oracle and Index, which together with the Protocol represent a closed ecosystem of work with NFT and their accounting/analysis system.&#x20;

Finally, the release of the full beta version of the Project is expected in June 2022.

Above is a general road map. Let us try to look at it in more detail:

So, from November 2020 to February 2021, DAO NIFTSY was formed and work on NFT market research began.&#x20;

In March, a minimal product was made and the team participated in the Binance hackathon.&#x20;

Currently, an Alpha version of the protocol is being worked on (until July 2021).&#x20;

After that, it is planned to refine the functionality of the Protocol and expand the Token's functions, including - in connection with the IDO in August-September.&#x20;

Next, the development of other elements of the Project starts: Oracle and Index, which together with the Protocol represent a closed ecosystem of work with NFT and their accounting/analysis system.&#x20;

Finally, the release of the full beta version of the Project is expected in June 2022. \


During development, we also take into account the gradual integration of the Protocol and other elements of the Project into the various LDCs, as follows:

The initial version of the Protocol is built on EVM-enabled blockchains (Ethereum, BSC and others).&#x20;

This is followed by integration with L2-level solutions such as Polygon and others.&#x20;

And then there is gradual integration with other DDN/DDS. At the time of writing (in alphabetical order): first turn - **Ethereum** (release), **BSC** (release), **Polygon** (release), **Avalanche** (MVP), EvmOS (MVP), **Ziiliqa (**&#x61;t work), **Wax** (at work), **Near** (at work). Second line - L2.&#x20;

Finally, we are guided by the following principles in implementing the said Roadmap:

Initial implementation dates are written down, if the project attracts more crowdfunding for development, the specified dates can be shifted towards better positions.&#x20;

It all depends on which projects integrate the Protocol and/or are willing to invest their own energy, time and other resources into its development.&#x20;

Finally, it also depends on the implementation of the roadmaps of the projects themselves: for example, as of today we expect Ethereum to move to version 2.0. \


Knowing all this - let's move on to the final part.\
