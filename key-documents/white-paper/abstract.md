# Introduction

This document describes the Envelop (NIFTSY) project consisting of four elements.

The main idea of the Envelop (NIFTSY) project is to create a system of decentralized systems’ (DAO, DeFi/DEX) interactions through the tokenization of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in first and high-level networks. Using decentralized models, ENVELOP (NIFTSY) creates objective metrics and an Asset Valuation System.

Envelop (NIFTSY) is based on the following common Web 3.0 trends:

* Self-nesting of heterogeneous top-level (applications, protocols, etc.) and low-level (blockchain solutions) objects/entities;
* User-driven openness and anonymity (the ability to monitor anonymous transactions in transaction scanners);
* Decentralization;
* Direct transfer of values without intermediaries;
* Equality of subject and object, etc.

This document will help even the untrained but inquisitive reader to become familiar with the architecture and interconnections of the three elements that make up the Envelop (NIFTSY) project. It reveals the main trends in the industry and provides a detailed description of each aspect.

In order to find additional information and evidence to support the points made here, a list of references is provided for each section/chapter. This also enhances the openness of the Envelop (NIFTSY) project.

The conclusions of the development trends’ assessment are set out in the Light paper. The project website will suffice for general guidance.
