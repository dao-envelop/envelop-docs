# General provisions

General provisions of tokenomics:

1. The total token emission is **500,000,000 NIFTSY** for all chains/DAGs.
2. The emission in each blockchain (or DAG, and/or other DDN) occurs according to a formula that reduces emission by **12%** from the previous DDN.
3. The emission initially occurs to a multisig DAO in the amount of 500,000,000, and then there is a primary burn for a given DDN.
4. The main functions of the token are listed in the corresponding section - these include participation in the DAO; use of dApps DAO Envelop functions; discounts, and other functions.
