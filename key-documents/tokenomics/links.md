**First** of all, you need to study the disclaimers, if you want to understand exactly why the NIFTSY token is a utility token: [https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/disclaimers](https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/disclaimers).&#x20;

**Secondly**, a general tokenomics scheme can be found at: [https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/tokenomics](https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/tokenomics).&#x20;

**Thirdly**, you can separately explore the role of Token in super-DAO ENVELOP: [https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/tokenomics/dao.-token.-ido](https://docs.envelop.is/key-documents/white-paper/tokenomics/dao.-token.-ido). Read more about this also in our separate article: [https://envelop.medium.com/protocol-oracle-index-token-or-why-niftsy-is-not-afraid-1bffc6a4b5da](https://envelop.medium.com/protocol-oracle-index-token-or-why-niftsy-is-not-afraid-1bffc6a4b5da).&#x20;

**Fourthly**, you can separately study a number of important explanatory articles about Token:

1. First, a piece on the evolution of IDO tokenomics (Initial DAO offering): [https://envelop.medium.com/niftsy-tokenomics-evolution-in-general-tones-bca5c0903708](https://envelop.medium.com/niftsy-tokenomics-evolution-in-general-tones-bca5c0903708);&#x20;
2. Further, there is also a separate post on the role of the token: [https://envelop.medium.com/exploring-the-four-pieces-of-niftsy-part-1-fe0196483704](https://envelop.medium.com/exploring-the-four-pieces-of-niftsy-part-1-fe0196483704);&#x20;
3. Finally, a selection of payment channels tokenization and roll-ups is worth exploring separately:
   1. Part I. Here: [https://envelop.medium.com/tokenization-of-payment-channels-and-roll-ups-envelop-niftsy-42478de52e23](https://envelop.medium.com/tokenization-of-payment-channels-and-roll-ups-envelop-niftsy-42478de52e23);&#x20;
   2. Part II. Here: [https://envelop.medium.com/tokenization-of-payment-channels-roll-ups-v-buterin-envelop-60800f7d41e6](https://envelop.medium.com/tokenization-of-payment-channels-roll-ups-v-buterin-envelop-60800f7d41e6);&#x20;
4. Separately, you can explore how deeply the NIFTSY practice cases have been developed by the time of the IDO in our DAO report, which we intend to publish at least once a quarter: [https://t.me/envelop\_en/19176](https://t.me/envelop_en/19176).&#x20;
