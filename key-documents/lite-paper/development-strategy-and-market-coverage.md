# Development strategy and market coverage

The project aims to integrate with players, such as marketplaces, exchanges (DEX, DeFi), DAOs, liquidity aggregators, game industry participants (cybersport, online games, meta-universes) and others.

The **development** **strategy** is based on global integration:

1. Oracle uses data from other protocols and oracles for a more objective assessment of the market and its segments;
2. Other decentralized indexes become the regulator of the Protocol's formal rules;
3. Any tokens can be used with or without a Project Token, but in the second case, transaction costs increase.

Thus, a Project may be decomposed into three independent parts and/or be represented as a set of four elements developing in parallel. It all depends on whether you want to integrate the Protocol, the Oracle, the Index, or use the whole functionality of the Project.
