# The main hypostases and parts of the Project

**The Project as a whole acts as**:

1. A cross-chain aggregator of liquidity wrapped in NFT of any order;
2. A formalizer for valuation of assets within NFTs of any level of complexity;
3. An automatic anti-fraud system for the NFT market and related industries.

**In** **doing** **so**, **the** **Protocol**:

1. Helps wrap and unwrap assets;
2. Templates the NFT creation process for platforms (marketplaces, exchanges, etc.);
3. Sets a minimum valuation for NFT at the expense of the accumulator.

**Oracle** **in** **turn**:

1. Creates a scoring system - initial valuation of assets through open data analysis;
2. Applies as a classical and/or AI-anti-fraud system, which allows each market participant to manage risk;
3. Systematizes all positive and negative patterns in the use of NFT of any order.

**Finally**, **Index**:

1. Becomes one of the first decentralized and collateralized simultaneously market indices for NFT and related assets (synthetic, among others);
2. Acts as a selling instrument and the initial unit of exchange;
3. Also, the Index verifies Oracle data, preventing manipulation by misrepresentation of information by participants.

**Besides** **these elements**, there is Token, which acts as their link: herewith, all three elements (Protocol, Oracle, Index) can be used independently, without Token, but it adds unique functionality to DAO NIFTSY:

1. Participation in royalty payments to any actor (subject, script, AI, etc.) by paying on any complex transactions in the subject-object model;
2. WUM mechanics is a dynamic part of drive, transaction processing;
3. Second- and subsequent-order NFT cross-chain exchange which functions are discount and netting rate;
4. Unification of token standards through a single wrapper format;
5. Tool for simplification and objectification of derivatives, that means valuation through turnover/pledge analysis of any tokens;
6. Token bonus model in the development of the Project ecosystem such as airdrops, bounty programs, etc.

Thus, the Token is a primitive cross-chain transfer mechanism for NFT wrapped assets (liquidity) and serves to reduce transaction costs.\
