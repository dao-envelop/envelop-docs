# Bounty rules

### Bug Bounty

**The Participant undertakes** not to provide information about the Project in any project (website, application, social network and/or elsewhere) by means of SPAM, rude references and/or in any other way that violates the applicable law of the jurisdiction where the project is registered as well as generally recognised principles and norms of international law and morality.&#x20;

**The summary table shows** the MAXIMUM total amount of tokens awarded for the Participant's active actions, which means that the Participant may receive fewer tokens. More than the maximum amount of tokens the Participant can receive only in coordination with the Project Funder, if the Participant's activities do not violate these Rules and if the Participant's actions have benefited the Project more than the average amount. Also, the calculation method described above does not take into account the reduction factor, which is set initially after the IDO and then increased up to 90% of the initial maximum figures each calendar quarter.&#x20;

**The article** (post/commentary/other material) must not discredit anyone's rights on the grounds of sex, race, language and/or religion, or in any other way (method) that degrades human dignity, i.e. the basic principles of openness, decentralisation, anonymity and respect for humanity must not be violated by contributions from Participants in any way.&#x20;

**A resource that meets** at least one of the following criteria is deemed to be unpopular for these rules: a) the total number of visitors to the resource is less than 1000 hits; b) the total number of participants in the chat/group/channel/page (account)/etc. is less than 1000; c) the resource is located off the Internet and its indicators cannot be verified with a sufficient degree of accuracy.&#x20;

**One of the following is considered as SPAM** under the Rules: a) mailing to email addresses/phone numbers/crypto wallets and/or other sources, if the database is not verified as belonging to the Member doing the mailing, i.e. an explicit user permission for inclusion in the database and the use of his final addresses (regardless of the form of presentation) has not been obtained.&#x20;

**Duration of the bounty programme**: IDO (3 calendar weeks), after IDO (1 quarter reduction factor - 10%: maximum reduction factor 90%)

### Translations

**Documents can be translated** if the document contains 1,000 characters or more and has not previously been translated into a given language.&#x20;

**If a translation has already been made**, the Participant may make improvements to it, after consulting the Project Team in advance about the specific aspects of the improvements.&#x20;

**The Participant may also verify** translate by other Participants if he or she believes that the transfers in question may not have been processed correctly.&#x20;

**Translation by automatic translation tools is NOT** permitted if the Participant has not processed the text to the extent that it meets the basic article design requirements for the Project (see above), nor if the general language rules of the original text and the text have been violated.&#x20;

**Any documents** other than White Paper, Lite Paper, Technical Paper and texts located on the official project GitHub and website may be translated without prior approval from the project team. Translation without prior agreement with the project team is also allowed in any languages other than English and Chinese

### Media

**The article must be at least 1000** characters long.&#x20;

**The article should NOT contai**n profanity or low profanity words (swear words), even if they are not profanity.&#x20;

**Articles published** on non-popular social networks/blogs are evaluated most carefully and, so that the Participant may not waste effort, each Participant is then required to pre-moderate the Project for approval of the particular resource.&#x20;

**The uniqueness of the article should be 90%-100%**. Quotations are allowed, but the source of the quotation must be indicated.&#x20;

**All articles should be written** in clear, literate language, taking into account existing punctuation, grammar and spelling of the language in which the article is written.&#x20;

**The use of articles produced** by automated means is strictly prohibited.&#x20;

**Articles that violate search engine rules** are strictly prohibited.

**An article in these Rules** is any text that describes a Project in accordance with the above rules of writing, regardless of the form in which such text is named: article, post, long-read, research, research paper (any format), etc.

### Social media

The rules for publishing on social media should follow the general rules and, at the same time, the rules for publications (articles).

### Design

We accept only unique designs that do not infringe on anyone's copyright and/or related rights
